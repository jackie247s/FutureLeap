         <h2>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</h2>
         <p>One of Future Leap’s foremost objectives is to remain involved in the community and strive towards its betterment with our resources both human and material. Our equation of success includes not only to be accountable towards our business duties and partners, but also the entire community. Therefore, Corporate Social Responsibility runs deep within Future Leap’s veins. We work tirelessly to not only promote a culture of health, safety and high standards, but one that also informs us to be accountable and take up the social responsibility of our customers, employees and the community as a whole.</p>
         <p>Our CSR policies encourage Future Leap’s leadership to employ sustainable practices in order to preserve the environment, supporting outreach initiatives so that we are a part of enhancing the welfare of our communities and investing in our people to enrich lives. Above all else lies our dedication and commitment to the well-being of both the people that work with us and the natural environment. This is ultimately what makes Future Leap a truly community-centric organization which strives to propel communities forward towards a collective good.</p>
